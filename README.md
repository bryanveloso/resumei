# Resumei

A simple experiment to create a resume builder for myself. It's generally unfinished. Resumei takes a JSON file and allows you to generate a PDF from it. You probably shouldn't use this unless you're a masochist.

## Directions

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To start a development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

To run for production:

```bash
bun start
```
